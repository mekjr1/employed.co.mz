# Copilot Instructions — employed.co.mz

## Project

FastAPI + Next.js job board with market selection by subdomain (`mx.*`, `mz.*`).
Frontend is in `frontend/`; backend is in `backend/`.

## Mandatory rules (from portfolio AI-OPS)

1. **No AI authorship trailers** — no `Co-Authored-By: Claude` lines, no
   "Generated with AI" footers in docs or commits.
2. **Never paste credentials** — reference file paths, not values.
3. **Locale codes** — `en`, `pt`, `es` only. Expand together across all products.
4. **Env var naming** — use standard names: `SENTRY_DSN`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`,
   `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
5. **Secrets posture** — never commit `.env`. See `.env.example` and service env examples.
6. **Port allocation** — frontend defaults to `localhost:3000`, backend to `localhost:8000`, MailHog to `8025` when used.

## Current workstream — harden UAT CI/CD into a prod-ready pipeline

UAT is live on Box 3 and stable, so the next priority is hardening
`.github/workflows/deploy-uat.yml` so it can be safely promoted into a
`deploy-prod.yml` later. **Do NOT introduce a prod workflow yet** — first close
the gaps below on UAT. Each item should ship as its own PR with a green CI
run before merge.

Concrete gaps (in priority order):

1. **Gate deploy on CI.** Today `deploy-uat.yml` triggers on every push to
   `uat`, racing `ci.yml`. Switch to `workflow_run` of `ci`
   (`types: [completed]` + `if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'`)
   OR add a `needs:` chain in a single workflow. A red CI must block the
   deploy job.
2. **Pin images by commit SHA.** Replace mutable `ghcr.io/mekjr1/employed-api:uat`
   tags with `:uat-${{ github.sha }}` (push *both* `:uat` and the SHA tag so
   the floating tag still works for humans). The deploy step then sets
   `IMAGE_TAG` in `.env` and `docker compose pull` + `up -d` uses the SHA.
   This is the foundation for rollback and for promoting an exact UAT image
   into prod.
3. **Run Alembic migrations as part of deploy.** `backend/alembic/versions/`
   exists but the workflow never executes `alembic upgrade head`. Add a
   `docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head` step after `pull`
   and before `up -d`. Fail the deploy if it errors.
4. **One-command rollback.** Add `scripts/rollback-uat.sh` that takes a prior
   SHA, edits `/opt/employed/.env`'s `IMAGE_TAG`, pulls, and restarts. Once
   step 2 ships, this becomes trivial.
5. **`concurrency:` group on deploy.** Two pushes in quick succession
   currently race each other on Box 3. Add
   `concurrency: { group: deploy-uat, cancel-in-progress: false }`.
6. **GitHub Environments + required reviewers.** Move UAT secrets behind an
   `environment: uat` block, then create an `environment: prod` with required
   reviewers — this is the protection prod will need on day one.
7. **Smoke beyond `/health`.** Today only backend `/health` is polled.
   Extend to: frontend `/`, both market hosts (`mx.employed.xibodev.com`,
   `mz.employed.xibodev.com`), and at least one read-only API journey
   (e.g. `GET /jobs?limit=1`). Fail the deploy on any non-2xx.
8. **Worker healthcheck override.** Worker container inherits the API's
   `/health` healthcheck, so it always reads "unhealthy" (see outer
   `SERVICES.md` TODO §1). Override in `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`.
9. **Image vulnerability scan.** Add a Trivy scan step on the built image
   *before* push; fail on HIGH/CRITICAL. Acceptable allow-list lives in
   `.trivyignore`.
10. **Deploy notifications.** Post success/failure + commit SHA + actor to a
    Slack/Discord webhook (see `_integrations/` if one exists; otherwise add
    `DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL` to repo secrets).

Acceptance for "ready to clone into `deploy-prod.yml`":
- A failing `ci.yml` blocks any UAT deploy.
- The deployed image tag on Box 3 maps 1:1 to a git SHA you can `git show`.
- `alembic upgrade head` runs every deploy and is visible in workflow logs.
- A documented rollback flips Box 3 back to the previous SHA in under 2 minutes.
- Box 3 surfaces a single, accurate health signal per container.

When all 10 items are green on UAT, the prod workflow is essentially a copy
with: different secrets, different host, `environment: prod` protection, and
manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger.
